title: RTL Support
---

If you want to support the dir attribute in your `<html>` tag, you can use the `getDir` function from the `createI18n` instance to get the direction of the locale.

```ts
const dir = getDir(locale);
```

Although we could use something native such as the `direction` value from the Intl.Locale API, this API is not yet compatible with Firefox and we would have to add a polyfill, so we have directly built a simple function that allows us to obtain the direction according to the locale.

## How it works

We have a set of languages that are RTL, and we have a function that allows us to obtain the direction of the locale.

```ts
const rtlLanguages = new Set([
  "ar", // Arabic
  "arc", // Aramaic
  "ckb", // Central Kurdish (Sorani)
  "dv", // Divehi, Dhivehi, Maldivian
  "fa", // Persian (Farsi)
  "ha", // Hausa (written in Arabic script)
  "he", // Hebrew
  "khw", // Khowar
  "ks", // Kashmiri
  "ku", // Kurdish (some dialects)
  "ps", // Pashto
  "sd", // Sindhi
  "ug", // Uyghur
  "ur", // Urdu
  "yi", // Yiddish
]);
```

So if the locale is in the set, we return "rtl", otherwise we return "ltr".
